WHAT IS THE SHELL AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT
- take over intro from training?
- keyboard, mouse & GUI great way to interact with computer, very intuitive
- not great for repetitive stuff -> takes time, causes (human) errors

- CLI still very much used to do exactly that, tell computers to do stuff over and over again. 
- Work on a bunch of files. Be able to do the very same thing on other files 6 months from now.
	-> repetitive
	-> reproducible

	---> PROGRAM

- a "shell" is a computer programm that interprets what we type, tells the computer what to do in computer-speak, then prints the result of the action:
R ead
E xecute
P print
L oop

- there are different shells, although they share a large set of commands. The most common nowadays is bash.
- by default, the Mac Terminal uses bash
- most Linux distros do too
 	how to be sure? type echo $SHELL
					  or ps
- the command prompt in Windows is also a shell, although it doesn't share the same command base as most UNIX shells
	to get a proper shell in Windows, use a 3rd-party like git-bash (comes with git)
	
	
	
HOW TO USE A SHELL
- shell prompt ($ in bash)
- we type in commands
	- e.g. whoami

	- what the shell does is
		- it finds the whoami program
		- runs it
		- prints its output
		- displays a new prompt -> we can type new stuff


- files are organised in folders on your computer (or at least they should be)
- we can navigate those folders using Windows Explorer or the Finder
	- example to sample data

- now if I want to act on those files, I need to open the folder they're in in the Finder
	- example
- if I want to act on them using CLI, I also need to navigate to that folder
- how do I know?
- we can try whereami
- doesn't work
- most commands are shortcuts - PROGRAMMERS ARE LAZY PEOPLE

- we use pwd instead - PRINT WORKING DIRECTORY
- prints the whole path, from the root of the filesystem
- on a Mac, it's often something like /User/yourname/Documents etc.
- slashes separate folders and subfolders
- first slash tells it's the root

- LS to list what's in a directory

- CD to CHANGE DIRECTORY
