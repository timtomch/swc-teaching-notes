When I teach OpenRefine, I don't insist too much on GREL vs Jython or the GREL concepts discussed today.
I usually make the parallel with Excel formulas - GREL is the way that OR does formulas



GREL = General Refine Expression Language (backronymed from the original Google Refine Expression Language)

GREL is not the only language supported by OpenRefine (can also use a variant of Python, and Clojure)
    - I believe those other languages have been added over time to provide some added capabilities
    - GREL is still the "default" language
    - It's what's done in the background when applying a common transform (function used will show up in info message)
    - Designed to look like JavaScript (dot notation, similar function names, + for concatenation, etc.)
    - Advantages of GREL
            - Limited list of available functions geared towards usual tasks done in OpenRefine
            - Fewer concepts to master for users not familiar with Python/Jython
            - Compact: expressions usually last on one line - compare with Jython where you have to import libraries, declare variables, etc.
    - Disadvantages
            - Syntax gets unwieldy for more complex operations, e.g. with with() function to store values in temporary variables
            - Limited functionality


Can be used in multiple places:
- Transforms and add column from this column (most used)
- To build URLs for API calls (add column by fetching URLs)
- Custom text facets
- In the template editor


Core concepts

- Each GREL function expects at least one ARGUMENT
    the argument is the input, what we "feed" the function
    
- GREL supports DOT NOTATION
    There are two ways of passing the first argument
        - within parentheses: toUppercase(value)
        - or with the dot notation: value.toUppercase()
        
    Still need to put the parentheses at the end to indicate it's a function call
    
    Can be confusing since the dot notation is also how you navigate through an object e.g. cells.ColumnName.value
    
    If there are more than one argument, the others are passed in parentheses:
        contains(value, "food")
        value.contains("food")
        
    Which one you use is a MATTER OF PREFERENCE
    - Dot notation can be easier to chain - less of an issue with multi-level parentheses like in Excel formulas
    - I find it more intuitive : value.contains("food") is closer to a natural language expression than contains(value, "food")
    
- Be mindful of data types (reference will tell you which type is expected)
    s : string
    b : boolean (True or False)
    n : number
    d : date
    a : array
    p : regex pattern
    o : object (any data type)
    
    + special "null" and "error" data types can be returned
    
    Use conversion functions to make sure you are using the right type.
    To input a literal string, use apostrophes:
    
        "food".contains("oo")
        food.contains("oo") will not work (GREL will look for an object, function called food...)

- Variables available within a GREL expression
    (chek if everyone is familiar with the concept of rows, columns and cells)
    
    More details: https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/expressions#variables
    
    value : content of the cell currently evaluated - most common
    row   : refers to the entire row that contains the cell currently evaluated
        row.index      : row number (zero-based)
        row.cells      : cells contained in the current row
        
            -> useful way to get data out of other columns if needed
            e.g. row.cells['URL'].value
        
        row.columnNames: column names in the dataset
        row.starred    : indicates if the row is starred
        row.flagged    : indicates if the row is flagged
    cells : shortcut to row.cells (I think)
    cell  : the current cell



How to "grow" a GREL expression - Examples

Use the preview to check

In the GREL Movies List project

Create a column with the month in which the movie was released

    value.split('-')[1]
    
        -> I can see how the split function works in the preview
        -> Square brackets mean it's returning an array
        
        
    Say I wanted to further filter by movies released in the summer
        I can do another column with a test
        Or combine with the previous one

        ["06","07","08"].inArray(value.split('-')[1])


    I don't need to create a column with this, the same formula can be used to create a custom facet


Create a facet by decade

    Try doing value / 10 -> not a number

    value.toNumber()/10  -> treated as integer

    value.toNumber() * 1.0 / 10 -> now it's a float

    We can use the fact that GREL defaults to integer:
    
    value.toNumber()/10 * 10    -> facet by decade


Use a regular expression

    Say we want to find all movies that have the word "girl" or "woman" in their title
    
    Use Regex101 to build the RegEx
    
        Sample data:
        
        Little Women
        Showgirls
        Gone Girl
        Another Woman
        When a Man Loves a Woman
    
    .*(girls?|woman|women).*   -> use the "i" flag
    
    value.match(/.*(girls?|woman|women).*/i)[0].toTitlecase()
    
    ATTENTION: match() only returns the first instance of a pattern. You cannot add the /g modifier...
        When there are multiple instances, use find() instead.
    
        find() can match against a regex, but you only have to specify the capturing group:
            value.find(/girls?|woman|women/i)[0] works but not value.find(/.*(girls?|woman|women).*/i)[0]
    
        I think this is due to a limitation in the Java built-in function that OpenRefine uses for this.
        When using a complex regex is the only option, it's better to use the re library in Jython.


Create a column with ROI (revenue / budget)

    (filter by "Girl" first -> there are some with budget = 0.0)

    if(value.toNumber() > 0, round(cells.gross.value.toNumber() / value.toNumber()), "N/A")
    
    (Or convert the whole columns to numbers first)
    
    Check values, needs a condition to check that budget is not null
    
    Woops, I did it on the Girls movies only -> undo + use the history function to retrieve the working GREL


Cross this list with data downloaded from Bechdel list

    Add column based on title column
    
    cell.cross("GREL Bechdel List","title").cells.rating.value[0]
    
    Show how to grow this function.
    Identify when we have objects, arrays, etc.


Navigate reconciliation objects

    (in GREL movie list, titles released in February have already been reconciled with Wikidata)

    e.g. cell.recon.candidates.length()
         cell.recon.candidates[0].id
         ...
         
         To access specific values within an array:
         forEach(cell.recon.candidates,c,c.id)

Navigate API response

    Star a few names and facet by star
    or filter by genre and select Romance
    
    Add column by fetching URLs
    "https://api.genderize.io?name=" + value.split(' ')[0]
    
    Then add another column based on this column
    
    value.parseJson().gender

    only retrieve this value when the probablility is higher than 0.99
    
    with(value.parseJson(),v,if(v.probability.toNumber() > 0.99,v.gender, NULL))
    
    -> with allows you to set a variable and reuse it
    
    Or try  https://api.agify.io
    
    Other example
    
    Star and facet by star a few of the reconciled values
    Add IMDB ID from reconciled values
    Use it to query
    
    "http://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/getMovieByImdbId?imdbid=" + value.substring(2)

Questions from participants

- Why does OpenRefine have its own scripting language?
    I believe it started with GREL before support for more complex scripting was added with Jython.
    It's a design choice, could also have used SQL, etc.
    In the end, GREL is pretty efficient at applying operations that resolve most of the use cases
    
- Is it related to other languages
    It was designed to be similar to JavaScript
    
- Advantages over Jython/Python
    See above.
    More compact, easier to learn because it's more limited
    Doesn't require installing libraries, etc.

- What's the difference between GREL and Regular Expressions
    RegEx is a syntax specific for matching text (find text patterns, extract certain information, search and replace) used within
    a variety of systems and programming languages. Can be used in GREL, eg with value.match(/regex/). Also used in Python, etc.
    
    https://regex101.com/ -> select the right "flavor" OpenRefine is written in Java, so this is the flavor to select.
    
- Pedagogics - what do you typically teach to a group of OpenRefine learners about GREL
    It depends on the level of comfort learners have with the software, experience with other tools
    Usually there's not much time to go very deep with GREL on a session on OpenRefine
    I personally believe that by teaching a tool, we want to show how it works, but also give a sense of its capability beyond what we can show.
    If learners see what can be done in GREL and we give them tools on how to get started (some examples, cheatsheet, link to doc), they
    can learn more to resolve their own problems.
    
    I show them some string manipulation functions. I show how to use the preview to check if the expression is working.
    I show how to grow an expression: start with a step, check the output, add the next step, etc.
    I show where to find help, use the in-app reference, use history, star expression they want to reuse
    
    When I have time I always do practical exercices. Have people try to work things out by themselves. Check results.

- Guidelines on when GREL is more powerful than built-in functions
    GREL can be a way to go beyond those pre-existing functions
    Faster to daisy-chain GREL functions than to do it in steps with built-in operations.
    Can be a matter of preference
    Some operations are not possible outside of scripting, e.g. parsing JSON
    
- Tricks for describing GREL for people for whom invoking Jython/python/GREL might invoke fear or panic
    - Acknowledge that learning something new is hard. It's OK to feel overwhelmed at first.
    - Compare GREL to Excel formulas : people are usually familiar with them
        Check with them how they feel. If they are struggling with dot notation, use parentheses instead, closer to Excel formulas.
    - I don't complicate by going into jython - I mention that it's an option for more complex queries
    - I show them some simple transforms, where to find help
    - Many transforms are available as common transforms with no coding required - you can use the power of OpenRefine without using GREL
    - Use the preview to quickly see how expressions are working
    - Start with something you need, the next time you'll remember it
    - It's another tool. You're familiar with Excel because you spent time using it, it will come with practice with OR and GREL too.
    - Usually after a session on Open Refine, people are excited about what OR can do that Excel cannot do and it's worth the effort
    - If you can use Excel to do what you need to do, then use Excel!
    
    - Big difference with Excel formulas: GREL transforms are not dynamic. Evaluated at time of creation only, 
      will not update when a value is updated. THIS INCLUDES CUSTOM FACETS
    - Also there are no functions to do sums, averages etc across a whole column.
      -> Use case for Excel and OpenRefine is not the same.
